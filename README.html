<h1 id="folding-arrow">folding-arrow</h1>

<p>jQuery plug-in for inserting arrow icons for foldable list items, sections, burger menu icons etc. as inline SVG with CSS support. This especially includes the possibility of state transformations animated by CSS transitions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.isg-software.de/foldingarrow/indexe.html">Project Homepage</a></p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Have a look at the demo page, and you&#8217;ll most certainly recognize the demonstrated icons, like triangle icons used to indicate whether a (sub)section is visible or collapsed/folded. One of the most common uses of such icons is in hierarchical lists to show list items with sub-lists and the state of the latter&#8217;s visibility. For a collapsed sublist, the icon is usually an arrow to the right, whereas the arrow points down if the sublist&#8217;s unfolded.</p>

<p>Since the actual look of the icon is not the major content of the HTML document, but simply a presentation style, a common way to achieve this is to simply add a class to the foldable list item which represents the logical state (open/visible or closed/collapsed/folded). The icon itself (being presentation) could simply be added by CSS, e.g. with rules like this:</p>

<pre><code class="css">li::before{ content: url(arrowRight.svg) }
li.open::before{ content: url(arrowDown.svg) }
</code></pre>

<p>Then the JavaScript which shows/unfolds the list item&#8217;s content simply has to add the class <code>open</code> to the <code>li</code> node, and the script code which hides/shows the item&#8217;s content has to remove that class again.</p>

<p>This CSS-only way with external image files has, however, some disadvantages. Especially the sizing / scaling of the image might be tricky (e.g. <code>content</code> can&#8217;t be sized by CSS but has have a fixed size and can&#8217;t depend dynamically on the font size). And when opening or closing the sublist, the image simply gets replaced, i.e. the arrow flips without animation. These were the main reasons for the development of this plug-in:</p>

<p>This plug-in dynamically inserts an inline-SVG image into the HTML. Other than externally loaded and embedded SVG documents, inline-SVG is a part of the HTML document and may be styled by the HTML document&#8217;s CSS. I.e. you may common define styles for the HTML list markup and for the included list icons at one central place.</p>

<ul>
<li>You may (actually <em>have to</em>) use CSS to size the icon and to define its properties like stroke, line width, fill color etc.</li>
<li>You may style the image and the text (list item, section heading etc.) accordingly, even add dynamic styles like a hover effect to both of them (see demos).</li>
<li>And of course, CSS transitions allow for a smooth, animated state transition like a rotating triangle, a flipping arrow sign or a plus being smoothly transformed into a minus (see demos).</li>
</ul>

<p>But the plug-in doesn&#8217;t stop there: It&#8217;s configurable, so you can even define the actual SVG image (in JavaScript). Some typical images are provided as presets (including a transition). You can simply use these presets, modify them or create some custom images from scratch.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> <em>This plug-in concentrates on drawing the SVG icon (which may be animated with CSS transitions). The actual content-folding is not part of this plug-in.</em> The demo page uses simple calls to jQuery&#8217;s built-in <code>slideDown()</code> and <code>slideUp()</code> functions, but the demo code still has to do at least <em>two</em> things on each click event: fold or unfold the content <em>and</em> toggle the CSS state class (like <code>open</code> in the example above) of the list item or heading in order to change the icon. And if you want Internet Explorer- or MS Edge support, the event handler even has to perform a third step by calling an additional plug-in function for transforming the icon (since these MS browsers don&#8217;t support CSS transformations on SVG).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m considering publishing another jQuery plug-in with the focus on showing and hiding sections and automatically toggling a state class of a corresponding &#8220;header&#8221; element, to make that job even easier. Both plug-ins may then be combined for very simple (un-)folding of sections or list items.</p>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting started</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s, for the start, assume, you have a simple unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) and want to use folding-arrows (right- or downpointing triangles by default) instead of normal list bullets for every list item (<code>&lt;li&gt;</code>) of that list (not including sublists inside its list items).</p>

<p>What do you have to do at least—in the simplest case?</p>

<ol>
<li>Fit the unordered list with the class <code>folding-arrows</code><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>:

<pre><code class="html">&lt;ul class=&quot;folding-arrows&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;...
		&lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt; <!-- sub list -->
	&lt;/li&gt;
	...
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li>Include the Script file as well as jQuery inside your HTML&#8217;s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:

<pre><code class="html">&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;dist/jquery-folding-arrow-icon-min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li>Include the default stylesheet that came along with the plug-in<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a>:

<pre><code class="html">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;dist/jquery-folding-arrow-icon.css&quot;&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li>Write some custom JavaScript code to apply the plug-in: Write a query selecting all list items which should be fitted with the folding arrow icon. In this case, we select every list item of any unordered list of class <code>folding-arrows</code>, see above. To prepend the icon to the selected list items, call the <code>prependFoldingArrowIcon</code> plug-in—in this simple case without arguments, which implies all options are left on default values:

<pre><code class="javascript">$(&quot;ul.folding-arrows &gt; li&quot;).prependFoldingArrowIcon();
</code></pre></li>
<li>The included CSS file (see step 3) already contains default styles for lists of class <code>folding-arrows</code>. Especially, it turns off the default bullets and indents the first line more to the left such that the inline SVG icon (being part of the content of the first line) is arranged to the left of the actual text content and—at least with default options—the actual content of the line following the icon and its separator<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a> aligns perfectly with the left margin of the following lines.<br />
<strong>But</strong> the CSS does <em>not</em> define default visual styles for the icon, nor does the plug-in. The latter simply draws a path forming a triangle, but you have to style that path on your own by adding CSS rules for the <code>stroke</code> and <code>fill</code> properties, like e.g.:

<pre><code class="css">.folding-arrow-icon path {
    stroke: none;
    fill: silver;
}
</code></pre></li>
<li>Now you have a folding-arrow icon able to indicate whether the contents of the list item are visible or not. But you still have to add JavaScript handlers to capture events (like a click on the icon or on a link in the list item) which should actually toggle the state (fold or unfold content). This event handler has to do three things:

<ol>
<li>Actually show or hide the content, and</li>
<li>add or remove the class <code>showing</code> to resp. from the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> item in order to flip the state of the indicator.</li>
<li>After adding/removing the <code>showing</code> class to/from the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> item, the handler should also call another jQuery plug-in function provided by this library: <code>$(…).transformFoldingArrowIcon()</code>.<br />
This is not actually mandatory, but it&#8217;s needed for compatibility with Microsoft&#8217;s browsers (Internet Explorer as well as Edge): Both don&#8217;t support SVG transitions defined via CSS, they only understand transition attributes inside the SVG&#8217;s DOM itself! The <code>transformFoldingArrowIcon</code> plug-in function therefore adds or removes a transition (by default a rotation by 90°) to/from the SVG&#8217;s DOM—dependent, by default, on the presence or absence of the <code>showing</code> class on the list item. It also supports adding a title to the image (e.g. showing as a pop-up when the mouse hovers over it) depending on the <code>showing</code> state, but by default, no title is added.
(As already said in the introduction, I&#8217;m considering publishing a further jQuery plug-in which will simplify this sixth step.)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>See the demo page for working examples. You may create a copy of the demo page as a playground for your own experiments.</p>

<p>Of course the plug-in is quite flexible and customizable. For one, it isn&#8217;t limited to be applied to list items, see demo page. It also doesn&#8217;t force you to stick to constraints like the use of the specific class <code>folding-arrows</code> and such. Those are simply defaults, and if you don&#8217;t want to stick to these defaults, you&#8217;ll have to do more customization. Especially the included CSS file applies default styles to elements equipped with default classes, and if you want to use other class names, you can&#8217;t simply use the default CSS file. Feel free to make a copy of the CSS and customize that to your needs. You should <em>not</em> edit the included stylesheet, since future updates of the plug-in might then overwrite and thus reset your local changes—also that would break the demo page.</p>

<h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>

<h3 id="css">CSS</h3>

<p>First of all, you <em>have to</em> write some own CSS code to style the looks of the generated icons (<code>stroke</code>, <code>stroke-width</code> and <code>fill</code>), see <a href="#gettingstarted">Getting Started</a>, step 5.</p>

<p>Further CSS customization can be done by replacing the included <code>jquery-folding-arrow-icon.css</code> file by a modified/customized stylesheet of your own. You may write a new stylesheet from scratch, make a copy of said CSS file and modify that or make a copy of the included <code>less</code> source, modify that and convert that into CSS by a less compiler.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s <em>not</em> recommended to modify the original <code>less</code> or <code>css</code> files, at least not outside of a fork of the original project, since your changes might be overwritten when downloading updates of this package.</p>

<h3 id="presets">Presets</h3>

<p>As demonstrated above in <a href="#gettingstarted">Getting Started</a>, you may call the plug-in functions without parameters and you get default icons with default options.</p>

<p>Actually, there are several alternative sets of default options available, mainly configuring different icons or transformations.</p>

<p>Currently, the following presets are included:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>arrow-right</code>: The is actually the default that is chosen if no options are configured at all: Right-pointing triangle rotating by 90 degrees when unfolding.</li>
<li><code>arrow-up-down</code>: The same triangle icon, but pointing either up or down, with a vertical flip transformation/transition.</li>
<li><code>plus</code>: Plus-icon with rotation by 45 degrees (i.e. transformation into an X icon) when unfolding.</li>
<li><code>plus-minus</code>: The same plus-icon, but transformed into a minus when unfolding by shrinking the vertical line.</li>
<li><code>burger</code>: A typical menu icon of three stacked horizontal lines, transformed into an X icon when unfolding.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two more presets exist which don&#8217;t contain transformations and are not meant to be transformed at all, but are intended to define some static list bullets for use in an unordered list of which only <em>some</em> entries are foldable (and should be equipped with a transformable icon like defined by the presets above), while others remain static. Acutally, for this case you might simply stick to standard HTML bullets, but if you want a more consistent look and want to style those list bullets, too, you may create them with this very same plug-in. These two presets for static bullets are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>dash</code>: A simple dash icon (should probably not be combined with the <code>plus-minus</code> preset, since expanded list items with a minus icon would not be easy to tell apart from static list items with dash icon, but is very well suited for combination with arrow presets, especially if the arrow is only outlined and not closed, i.e. a chevron).</li>
<li><code>disc</code>: A small circle icon (via CSS you define wheter to draw a circle outline or a filled dot).</li>
</ul>

<p>All these presets are demonstrated in the included demo page.</p>

<p>A preset is simply called by passing the option <code>preset</code> with the name of the preset as argument (string literal), e.g.:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">$(&quot;ul.folding-arrows &gt; li&quot;).prependFoldingArrowIcon({
	preset: &quot;plus-minus&quot;
});
</code></pre>

<p>If you plan to use the <code>transformFoldingArrowIcon</code> plug-in function (upon each state change) for IE-/Edge compatibility, then you should also once call the <code>setupFoldingArrowIconTransformation</code> function (usually directly after the prepend-/append-function) with exactly the same preset argument:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">$(&quot;ul.folding-arrows &gt; li&quot;).prependFoldingArrowIcon({
	preset: &quot;plus-minus&quot;
}).setupFoldingArrowIconTransformation({
	preset: &quot;plus-minus&quot;
});
</code></pre>

<h3 id="plug-inoptions">Plug-in options</h3>

<p>The main <code>prepend-</code> and <code>appendFoldingArrowIcon</code> plug-in functions may be customized with some options defined in <code>$.fn.appendFoldingArrowIcon.DEFAULTS</code> alias <code>$.fn.prependFoldingArrowIcon.DEFAULTS</code> (by default both variables refer to the same object of default properties).</p>

<p>You may globally (for your project) modify these defaults by changing that <code>DEFAULTS</code> object. Or you may pass an object of individual options to the plug-in function call like e.g.:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">$(&quot;ul.folding-arrows &gt; li&quot;).prependFoldingArrowIcon({
	closePath: false,
	viewboxMargin: 2
});
</code></pre>

<p>All options that you don&#8217;t include into that argument object will remain on default setting. This can also be combined with the <code>preset</code> option, in which case any given option overrides the default defined by that preset, and any not included option remains on the preset&#8217;s default, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">$(&quot;ul.folding-arrows &gt; li&quot;).prependFoldingArrowIcon({
	preset: &quot;arrow-up-down&quot;,
	viewboxMargin: 2
});
</code></pre>

<p>The same goes for the <code>setupFoldingArrowIconTransformation</code> plug-in function.</p>

<h4 id="optionsforappendprependfoldingarrowicon">Options for <code>append|prependFoldingArrowIcon</code></h4>

<p>A list of the supported options (along with their default values) can be found in the source code:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">	/**

		 * The option viewboxMargin can then be used to define the width of a margin 
		 * around the actual icon. A margin may be essential, if you don't just create
		 * a filled graph without stroke, but if you have a stroke greater than zero:
		 * If graph points touch the edge of the viewboxRadius square, the stroke will
		 * then extend into the margin and would be clipped without one.
		 * Also, during rotation transitions the transition paths of some of the 
		 * graph's points may easily leave the main graph region defined by the 
		 * viewboxRadius.
		 * The default values define a 10-by-10-pixel area for the graph and a 1px margin
		 * around that. Whenever you use the graph option to define your own graph and
		 * you don't want to describe your graph with coordinate of this 10x10 area,
